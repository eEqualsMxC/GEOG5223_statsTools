# statsTools

statsTools is a Python script tool for ArcGIS. The script provides quick means to scratch render simple spatial staistics.    


## Description

The purpose of the script is to make quick renderings of simple spatial staistics on a sigle attribute of data. 
That said, the attribute will need to be quantitative and acceptable data types are floats, integers, and shorts.
Furtherly, the script is mostly written from scratch and the only usage of a non-standard python library is an Arcpy package 
to process the symbology of the map.


## Installation

There are no special instalations to run the script. However, there are special packages and licences to operate the script.
The mininnium requirements are an ArcGIS standard licenese and the numpy package.
